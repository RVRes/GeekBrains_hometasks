    <h2><i>Описание товара</i></h2>
    <p>
        The Quiver Killer is a round tail hybrid surfboard from Lost. With the Short Round template for the nose, the low entry rocker then blends into the round tail which gives this board the ability to be fast on waves but still has the easy paddling and take off.

    <h2>Подробное описание</h2>
    <p>
        The Quiver Killer works well in small surf with the larger surface area and volume but the tail and nose have been pulled in meaning it gets more aggressive in larger waves with power behind them. The added rocker stops the rails from feeling 'boggy' in larger surf. A great board for all round conditions, feels fun and effortless in small surf whilst precise and forgiving in more powerful waves.
    </p>
    <p>
        This board comes as a 5 fin setup which means it can be ridden as either a classic 3 fin thruster or as a quad. Please note that fins are sold separately.
