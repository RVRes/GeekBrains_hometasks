    <p class="short_description">
        This design is kept simple. The volume is the starting point of the design; we needed as much as possible in an easy to move, flowing surfboard. The Chilli Bean’s naughty little brother is ready for some trouble!

        <h2>Подробное описание</h2>
        <p>
            The great outline template of the Chilli Bean means you can have a load of volume but can still surf the board off of the tail in smaller waves. The rockers have been raised to offer a bit more hold and mobility when the board gets its speed up, something that comes as a given when riding a plan shape like this at high volume. In a nutshell this means it’s very easy to catch the wave, and very easy to get instant speed. Now with the increased rockers we feel this board has more control than anything else out there with similar volume.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concaves are a double through the fins and centre of the board with a light single running throughout. This gives lift and drive, helping with that instant speed. The rail shape is brought down to a 60/40 performance shape, with a little boxiness to keep the board high in the water coupled with a slight decrease in foam through the tail area of the rail to ensure bite when back foot surfing.
